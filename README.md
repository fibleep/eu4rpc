EU4 RICH DISCORD PRESENCE INTEGRATION
-
This script updates your discord status with the country you're currently playing as in Europa Universalis IV.

Currently this only works in normal Singleplayer and Multiplayer, Iron Man files are encrypted and thus, unreadable.

Your status will be updated with multiple things:
-
-Country Flag (Discord app has a limit on country flags so not every flag is supported)
-
-Country Rank
-
-Country Name
-
-Current in-game Date / Singleplayer or Multiplayer
-
flags in 'EUIV Flags' folder are just there for reference
